# Timed Coding Quiz

## Description

### **This repository includes all files of my timed coding quiz application**

The quiz itself consists of 5 multiple choice questions, and as an added challenge, it permits only 1 minute to complete. To further add to this challenge, every wrong answer selected will reduce that timer by 6 seconds. If you finish within the allotted time, the application will ask for initials to save and display your score on the high score leaderboard. If not, a time's up screen will appear and you must restart the quiz to do so. At any time, the user can reach the highscore page by clicking the highscore link in the header. Highscores on the leaderboard are saved in local browser data, however it can be cleared with the clear button.

### Developing the Application

My gratification from completing this application is immeasurable. Not particularly because it works, but more so because of my deepened understanding javascript functions and web APIs. When I set out myself to the task of making this quiz, I knew javascript is where I'd face most my challenges. And indeed it was. Namely, DOM manipulation was a key target for me to work on. I struggled to find reasoning behind manipulating DOM elements when functions can simply display or hide existing HTML markup. While that was still a principle I applied here in the quiz, it wasn't until I got to developing the highscores leaderboard that I truly understood the value of DOM manipulation through Javascript. Having local data store scores and changing the DOM accordingly really was the most fun part of this challenge to me because that is where it all came together. For future projects, I will applying these learned skills.

### Future Development of this Application

Some things to improve will be to add many more questions. Currently it is the same 5 questions being cycled through, and moreover, in the same order each time. Ideally, I'd like to create a library of atleast 100-200 questions, but as a proof of concept, this will have to do for now as I try to prioritize my learning elsewhere.
